# drum-kit-web-site
Drum-kit-we-site is a hub for drummer games where you can play beats for drums with virtual drum kits and pads.A drum kit — also called a drum set, trap set or simply drums — is a collection of drums and other percussion instruments, typically cymbals, which are set up on stands to be played by a single player,with drumsticks held in both hands, and the feet operating pedals that control the hi-hat cymbal and the beater for the bass drum. A drum kit consists of a mix of drums  and idiophones ⁠— ⁠most significantly cymbals, but can also include the woodblock and cowbell . In the website, some kits include electronic instruments . Also, both hybrid  and entirely electronic kits are used.

## Purpose:
<ul>
  <li>To save on the space needed: Normally, because one needs both electronic drums and acoustic drums, this is the 
     splendid space saving solution for one.</li>
  <li>To save on the cost of an extremely expensive electronic drum set while cheap electronic drum sets are about the same 
     pricing as the hybrid acoustic-electronic drumset with all the added bonuses.</li>
</ul>
